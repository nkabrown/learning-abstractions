# Learning Abstractions

We have minds and the concepts needed exist in plenty of good resources. What is needed is learning abstractions, tools to solve the problem of moving those concepts from resources into memory.

What is an abstraction? According to the great programming book [CTMCP](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html) an abstraction is a tool or device that solves a particular problem. The problem that learning abstractions seek to solve is making learning effective and efficient so that it results in durable knowledge. Durable knowledge can be retrived at will and used with skill. As [Donald Norman's](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Memory-Donald-Norman/dp/0716713004/) definition says "learning is the act of deliberate study of a specific body of material, so that the material can be retrieved at will and used with skill".
